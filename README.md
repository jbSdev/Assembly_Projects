### Assembly Projects

RISC-V, x86 and x86-64 projects made by me as part of the ECOAR (Computer Architecture) course as Warsaw University of Technology (Winter 2025 semester).

The exercise given is finding image markers in a .bmp file.

Example markers:
![Example markers](https://galera.ii.pw.edu.pl/~zsz/ecoar/images/find_markers/example_markers.bmp)

The program should load the image, check its correctness and output all positions of marker 1.
